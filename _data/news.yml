            An Emigrant's Farewell  
            Adieu! all ye scenes of my childhood's dear home  
               -With you I no longer can stay  
            But my heart is the same, and where'er I may roam  
               -Your memory shall never decay  
            Anonymous, The Globe: 29 June 1858
