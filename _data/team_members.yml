Currently, he is in the last semester of his Ph.D. in Computer Sciences from the same institution, expecting to join the project Visual analytics for text-intensive social science research on immigration (VisAn-MIG) lab as a postdoc. As part of his graduate studies, Mariano received an Encouragement of Scientific Vocations Scholarship granted by the National Interuniversity Council (CIN), Argentina. His work during that time focused on Adaptive learning Applied to Contextualized Information Retrieval. Later he received a full doctoral scholarship granted by the Argentinian National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET), to pursue a doctorate in Computer Science under the supervision of the Dra. Ana G. Maguitman and Dr. Fernando A. Tohmé. The main research topics include causality structure learning, econometrics, natural language processing, and machine learning. During his Ph.D., he received additional scholarships and recognitions: Emerging Leaders in the Americas (ELAP) Program (2019) and Google Latin America Research Awards (2019 and 2020). In addition to his research work, he is also Head of Teaching Assistants in an Object-oriented programming course, and Teaching Assistant in a Computer Networking course, and in another on Embedded Systems."

  description: Dr. Sevgur is a sociologist with research and teaching interests in contemporary political economy, gender, and international migration. Her research examines issues of feminization of work, skills, and migration in the context of local and global inequalities, in addition to gender dynamics, and family relations across transnational spaces. Her latest field work was in Georgia and Turkey, which focused on the paid and unpaid social reproductive labour power of post-Soviet female migrants who work as live-in domestic workers in Istanbul. In Canada, she has studied various ethnic migrant groups, and explored the role of transnational and diasporic networks regarding sense of belonging and identification in Atlantic Canada and other provinces. Dr. Sevgur is actively engaged with subjects of migration and settlement by taking part in research projects which evaluate settlement programs, and in forums that are designed for knowledge transfer and policy formulation.
